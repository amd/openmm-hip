# OpenMM HIP Plugin

This plugin adds HIP platform that allows to run [OpenMM](https://openmm.org) on CDNA and RDNA
AMD GPUs on [AMD ROCmâ„¢ open software platform](https://rocmdocs.amd.com).

## Installing with Conda

This plugin requires hipFFT and rocFFT, install them from ROCm repositories:

```sh
apt install hipfft rocfft
```

```sh
conda create -n openmm-env -c streamhpc -c conda-forge/label/openmm_rc -c conda-forge --strict-channel-priority openmm-hip
conda activate openmm-env
```

This command creates a new environment, installs OpenMM and the plugin and activates the new
environment. A label `openmm_rc` is required because the current release version of the OpenMM
package (7.7) does not support the HIP plugin.

**Note:** `cudatoolkit` is a large (about 1 GB) dependency of `openmm` package, however it is not
required for the HIP plugin. It is possible to install a tiny "shim" package instead (for more
information see
[this comment](https://github.com/openmm/openmm/issues/3059#issuecomment-891653746)):

```sh
conda create -n openmm-env -c jaimergp/label/unsupported-cudatoolkit-shim -c streamhpc -c conda-forge/label/openmm_rc -c conda-forge --strict-channel-priority openmm-hip
conda activate openmm-env
```

Verify your installation (HIP must be one of available platforms):

```sh
python -m openmm.testInstallation
```

If there is no HIP among available platforms check why the HIP platform fails to load:

```sh
python -c "import openmm as mm; print('---Loaded---', *mm.pluginLoadedLibNames, '---Failed---', *mm.Platform.getPluginLoadFailures(), sep='\n')"
```

Run tests:

```sh
cd $CONDA_PREFIX/share/openmm/tests/
./test_openmm_hip.sh
```

Run benchmarks (see more options `python benchmark.py --help`):

```sh
cd $CONDA_PREFIX/share/openmm/examples/
python benchmark.py --platform=HIP
```

To remove OpenMM and the HIP plugin, run:

```sh
conda uninstall openmm-hip openmm
```

## Building

This project uses [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) for its build system.

The plugin requires source code of OpenMM, it can be downloaded as an archive
[here](https://github.com/openmm/openmm/releases) or as a Git repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/openmm/openmm.git
```

To build the plugin, follow these steps:

1. Create a directory in which to build the plugin.

2. Run the CMake GUI or ccmake, specifying your new directory as the build directory and the top
level directory of this project as the source directory.

3. Press "Configure".

4. Set OPENMM_DIR to point to the directory where OpenMM is installed.  This is needed to locate
the OpenMM header files and libraries.

5. Set OPENMM_SOURCE_DIR to point to the directory where OpenMM source code is located.

6. Set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to the directory where the plugin should be installed.  Usually,
this will be the same as OPENMM_DIR, so the plugin will be added to your OpenMM installation.

7. Press "Configure" again if necessary, then press "Generate".

8. Use the build system you selected to build and install the plugin.  For example, if you
selected Unix Makefiles, type `make install`.

Here are all commands required for building and installing OpenMM with HIP support from the latest
source code:

```sh
mkdir build build-hip install

git clone https://github.com/openmm/openmm.git
cd build
cmake ../openmm/ -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install -D OPENMM_BUILD_COMMON=ON -D OPENMM_PYTHON_USER_INSTALL=ON
make
make install
make PythonInstall
cd ..

git clone https://github.com/amd/openmm-hip.git
cd build-hip
cmake ../openmm-hip/ -D OPENMM_DIR=../install -D OPENMM_SOURCE_DIR=../openmm -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install
make
make install
```

If you do not want to install OpenMM Python libraries into the user site-packages directory
remove `-D OPENMM_PYTHON_USER_INSTALL=ON`.

Use `ROCM_PATH` environment variable if ROCm is not installed in the default directory (/opt/rocm).

## Testing

To run all the test cases build the "test" target, for example by typing `make test`, or call
`ctest --output-on-failure --repeat until-pass:3` (retry three times so stochastic tests have
a chance).

## Troubleshooting and performance tuning

### FFT backends

There are 3 implementations (backends) of FFT, the default is VkFFT.
If some tests fail or you suspect that your simulation with PME produces incorrect results,
please try different backends:

* the built-in FFT implementation (`export OPENMM_FFT_BACKEND=0`).
* the hipFFT/rocFFT-based implementation (`export OPENMM_FFT_BACKEND=1`);
* the VkFFT-based implementation (`export OPENMM_FFT_BACKEND=2`);

### The kernel compilation: hipcc and hipRTC

By default, the HIP Platform builds kernels with the hipcc compiler. To run the compiler, paths
in the following order are used:

* `properties['HipCompiler']`, if it is passed to Context constructor;
* `OPENMM_HIP_COMPILER` environment variable, if it is set;
* `${ROCM_PATH}/bin/hipcc`, if `ROCM_PATH` environment variable is set;
* `/opt/rocm/bin/hipcc` otherwise.

There is an alternative way to compile kernels: hipRTC, it is implemented by
`plugins/hipcompiler`.  To enable this way:

* set `properties['HipAllowRuntimeCompiler'] = 'true'`;
* set `OPENMM_USE_HIPRTC` environment variable to 1 (`export OPENMM_USE_HIPRTC=1`).
